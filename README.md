# Hijri Week Calendar Standard

This is the home repo for the Hijri Week Calendar Standard. The standard is a proposal for an ISO 8601 counterpart for Hijri week dates. The standard is intended to be used in conjunction with already existing Islamic calendar standards, such as the Umm al-Qura calendar, and is designed to be as compatible as possible with the ISO 8601 calendar.
